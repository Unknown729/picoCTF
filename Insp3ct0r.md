### Description:
Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/9670/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:9670

Let's check the link out, eh? Simple website with 2 tabs that we can select. Nothing else seems to be important or standout. 

Let's check its code then,.... Seem like normal codes all the waaaaayyyaaaait up, what is that comments at EOF??? What could it be?
