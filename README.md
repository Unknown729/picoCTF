PicoCTF is a fun Capture The Flag activities

The purpose of this repository is not copy and paste for flags but to expand the knowledges regarding to information security through numerous exercises PicoCTF has to offer for us to learn. For each .md file regarding to exercise, I'll include what I tried that didn't work and work my ways through and around to resolve for flags.
